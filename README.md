A Drupal Docker image for testing and development
=====

Which branch to use?
-----

Branch naming comprises three parts: the Drupal version (6.x, 7.x, ...); the proposed usage (dev = module development, the only one for now); and the version of this Dockerfile (1.x, 2.x, ...).

Each branch should contain information in its README file:

 * [6.x-dev-1.x](https://github.com/alberto56/docker-drupal/tree/6.x-dev-1.x) is experimental.
 * [7.x-dev-1.x](https://github.com/alberto56/docker-drupal/tree/7.x-dev-1.x)
 * [7.x-dev-2.x](https://github.com/alberto56/docker-drupal/tree/7.x-dev-2.x)
 * [8.0.x-dev-1.x](https://github.com/alberto56/docker-drupal/tree/8.0.x-dev-1.x)
