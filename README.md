A simple Drupal Docker image for testing
=====

Which branch to use?
-----

Branch naming comprises three parts: the Drupal version (6.x, 7.x, ...); the proposed usage (dev = module development, the only one for now); and the version of this Dockerfile (1.x, 2.x, ...).

Each branch should contain information in its README file:

 * [7.x-dev-1.x](https://github.com/alberto56/docker-drupal/tree/7.x-dev-1.x)
 * [7.x-dev-2.x](https://github.com/alberto56/docker-drupal/tree/7.x-dev-2.x)
 * _This branch_: [6.x-dev-1.x](https://github.com/alberto56/docker-drupal/tree/6.x-dev-1.x) is experimental.

This branch: 6.x-dev-1.x
-----

This branch is designed for developing Drupal 6 sites, and is experimental.
